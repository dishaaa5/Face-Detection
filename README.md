# Face-Detection
This repository contains a Python project that demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV and Haar Cascades. It uses the computer's webcam to capture video frames, detects faces within those frames, and draws red rectangles around the detected faces. The program continues running until the user presses the "Esc" key to exit.
